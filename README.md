⭐ welcome to my advent of code progress tracking! 

📆 every day (ish) i update this with any solutions i successfully create (aka: all the code in this repo is WORKING; wip code is not logged here)

🗒️ i am slightly behind on these because of finals season but i'm catching up! 

💯 my goal is to do better than last year, where i made it to day 15 part 1
