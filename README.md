⭐ welcome to my advent of code progress tracking! 

📆 every day (ish) i update this with any solutions i successfully create (aka: all the code in this repo is working; wip code is not logged here)

💯 my goal is to do better than last year, where i made it to day 15 part 1 (33 total stars) - i am currently at ⭐26⭐ total stars

↪️ i am slightly out of order due to finals season but i'm catching up!
